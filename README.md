### Tasks

You may complete these tasks in PHP using the stub code provided or use another stack of your choice
to implement the functionality.  

* Implement the function in user_class.php to select data form database based on passed in parameters.  I have
included stub code with comments to suggest method.  
  * Use joins to get the address info.  ()
* Implement the function in user_class.php to add a user to the database.
* Implement a function to modify user data in the database.
  * For these use PDO prepared statements to make database queries.
* Make the user_class.php into a php class with the above functions as methods.
* users.php is the file that would be called form AJAX in index.php.
  * import the user_class.php and use the method function of the user_class to add user to database.

Feel free to add to this as you see fit.
